# MurderOnMyMind
A mini reflex shooter game made in pure JS, CSS, and HTML. Inspired by games like Duck Hunt. Thanks to Pascal Cong√®s (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGhWyV4YjvMNlW2fGigu6Sg) for a great tutorial to get me started! Sounds mostly from SoundsCrate, but some are from ZapSplat or other free sound websites. This game works best on a desktop with a mouse.
# Instructions:
There are 4 levels to the game. After defeating all the enemies you will automatically be transitioned to the next level. Click to shoot. On the bottom left hand corner, you can switch your firemode. Just click it. By the way, LMG stands for light machine gun. Each enemy has 20 health (except for those at the last level) and the guns do different amounts of damage. There is also a settings menu at the top of your screen. There you can turn on or off optional features, like squishy sound effects. The latter is, by default, off.
## Important:
Please read the known bugs so as to not break the game.
# Gun info:
Rifle: 15 damage, 300 ms cooldown

Sniper: 30 damage, 1 second cooldown

LMG: 5 damage, 100 ms cooldown

# Known bugs:
This game maxes out audio object limits pretty fast with gun shot noises, especially the LMG. This stops audio from working. When using the LMG fire mode, please don't randomly click all over the screen to stop this bug from happening.
